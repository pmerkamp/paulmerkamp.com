									<h2>Don't Mind Me!</h2>
									<h3>Ludum Dare 46</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The final version is playable in-browser <a href="https://paul-merkamp.itch.io/dont-mind-me">here</a>.
									The source Unity project is also downloadable there to anyone who'd like to see an additional sample of my code or use the assets I created.<br>
									
									<h3>Overview</h3>
									Ludum Dare 46 was the first game jam I've ever participated in. The theme was "Keep it alive", and the jam ran from 
									April 17th to April 20th, 2020. The game ranked 354th of 4,959 "compo" entries, putting it just outside top 7%. Not bad for my first game!<br><br>
									
									From the start, based on the theme, I knew I wanted to create a game where the player was forced to carry something around, protecting it at all costs - 
									this idea coalesced into the disembodied brain that eventually represented the game. Originally, the player was going to place turrets 
									which would defend waves of enemies. However, as the reality of the 48 hour time constraint set in, I realized that 
									developing a fun and functional turret system would be an inefficient use of my time. <br><br>
									
									So, I honed the scope of the project. Instead, the player was given a handheld gun (very similar in appearance to the Polar Star
									in "Cave Story") and would use it to traverse themed areas, defeating increasingly difficult enemies, until the end was reached.
									I never came up with a story for this - perhaps the player is carrying their own brain to safety, or perhaps they are escorting
									a friend. Leaving the narrative in the hands of the player felt like the natural choice since I was mostly focused on game functionality.<br><br>
									
									The result was a colorful world, fun to explore, with a clear objective. The project did have some serious flaws, but overall, I was very 
									satisfied with the end result. The development process deepened my appreciation and love for video games, the development process, 
									and coding in general. <br><br>
									
									The project had some highs and lows that I want to briefly explore here. <br><br>
									
									<h3>Strengths</h3>
									Reviewers found the presentation of the game's mechanics very fun and intuitive - the first room, pictured above, informs the player 
									of which keys they need to press to shoot their gun and proceed (spacebar) as well as 
									to pick up the brain in the jar (E). I also received lots of positive feedback 
									regarding the game's art style. I was pleased by this, as the simple pixel art took very little time to create, but I did take time 
									to select color palettes for each area that would be enjoyable to discover for the player. I even took a couple of opportunities to hide little 
									"sneak peeks" of the next area, showing off these palettes before they were fully employed. In the same vein, a few players also mentioned their 
									appreciation of the player's bouncy walking animation. I hadn't done any scripted animation work prior to this, so getting something natural 
									to work was quite the achievement for me.<br><br>
									
									One of my favorite parts of the whole jam - in my entry's description, I challenged players to find a cute little character 
									named Shmoop, who was tucked away in a secret room. Those who found Shmoop were overjoyed!
									To my delight, one player even took it upon himself to escort Shmoop to the end of the game. I really love player-managed difficulty in games, 
									and this idea of self-imposed challenge is one I'm very interested in exploring in future projects.<br><br>
									
									<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
									Unfortunately, in the final few hours of the jam, I still needed to cap the game off with a finishing sequence, and had no time 
									for even a simple soundtrack. This, along with the grating sound effects that were included in the judged version of the game,
									meant that sound design was the weakest element of the project, which was reflected in the reviews it received. The game also 
									suffered from high artificial difficulty - death means starting from the very beginning of the game, which meant a game over during 
									the final boss was extremely demotivating for players. This issue was worsened by the player's slow walk speed. At times, this served 
									the exact purpose I intended it for - to build tension and anticipation for the next area - but more frequently, it was an annoyance. 
									There was also no gauge indicating remaining health for the player, meaning the only way to figure out how much punishment the little blue 
									fella could take was through painful trial and error.<br><br>
									
									The initial release also had some strange glitches - players could be pushed completely into walls by enemies, forcing them to 
									restart when they hadn't done anything wrong. I was able to resolve this issue in a follow-up release, but the game still has a number 
									of strange (mostly graphical) interactions, like sprites layering incorrectly, that I determined I'd be unable to fix without a 
									major time investment.<br><br>
									
									These issues were all on my radar while I was developing, but the time constraint meant I just didn't have time to resolve them! 
									In most cases, I was consciously sacrificing stability for content. Who knew 48 hours isn't enough to make the perfect game?<br><br>
									
									<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
									I'd made a number of tenative forays into game development, but my commitment to the Ludum Dare competition, and the limitations I was 
									faced with, gave me the opportunity to produce something truly playable and enjoyable for the very first time. My coding chops were stretched to 
									their absolute limit, and I was forced to learn a lot of new skills (new coding techniques, Unity quirks, split-second decision making...) 
									in a very short amount of time. I'm convinced that my merit as a professional in the field jumped because of LD46, 
									and I'm looking forward to participating again!

									<h2>Samuel</h2>
									<h3>JCA Student Collaborative Project</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									In Spring 2020, I composed a 12-minute piece called "Samuel" for brass quartet and piano,
									to be premiered at Butler University's JCA Collaborative. This piece would have been played live, accompanied by dance choreographed by 
									Jacob Shoup, one of Butler's fine dance majors and a good friend of mine. Unfortunately, due to the transition to an online semester,
									2020's JCA Collaborative was cancelled, and the piece was never performed.<br><br>
									
									You can listen to a MIDI of the piece and view its score on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5p3tVvGdYWH9piLIf6l63g">here</a>. (link broken)
									
									<h3>Overview</h3>
									The piece is divided into three sections: an expository first section, a slow and reverant middle section which gradually picks up energy and speed,
									and an exciting final section which unites themes from the first two sections, drawing to a powerful close.

									<h2>Motivic Frequency and Development in <br>«Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks»</h2>
									<h3>Butler University Music Theory Exhibition, Fall 2018</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Under the guidance of Butler University's Dr. Andrew Farina and Dr. Gail Lewis, I wrote a paper, designed a poster, and 
									delivered a presentation all on the significance 
									of motifs and their development in Richard Strauss' «Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks». This was my first public academic work, 
									and to date, I am still very pleased with the result.<br><br>

									<h3>Original Paper</h3>
									“Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks” is a tone poem by German composer Richard Strauss. It
									describes its titular character, the prankster Till Eulenspiegel, joyfully pulling practical jokes on the
									people around him. The piece is well-known for its colorful musical descriptions of its characters, and
									certain iconic excerpts are frequently used as audition material, especially in the horn. Strauss
									effectively personifies the characters in his piece through the use of strong, memorable motifs. First, I
									will give a brief overview of the piece and how it fits together. Then, I will identify which sections best
									illustrate these motifs, and I will provide a deeper look at how Strauss used his strong motifs to his
									advantage in each section.<br><br>
									The piece starts with a dream-like introduction. The introduction is followed by the first
									instance of Till’s first motif in the solo horn. The rest of the first section focuses on the reiteration and
									development of this motif, ensuring that the audience is familiar with Till’s trademark voice. The start
									of the second section is marked by a devious second motif in the clarinet, recognizable as a developed,
									rhythmically diminished version of the introduction. This motif is intended to show Till’s “wheedling”
									nature. In this section, the third and final Till motif is also triumphantly introduced, with traces of the
									first two motifs also present. The audience can expect to see these motifs in nearly every remaining
									section of the piece, as Strauss includes them to indicate Till’s presence in every situation. All three
									motifs are given a chance to interact, and then the third section begins. Townspeople, illustrated by the
									high strings, peacefully interact with one another. Suddenly, Till causes chaos with a loud prank,
									indicated by a cymbal crash. Frantic, messy, and harmonically unstable, this section passes quickly,
									with traces of Till’s motifs indicating a sneaky escape.<br><br>
									In the fourth section, tonic shifts to B-flat Major, and the audience hears the stoic motif of the
									town clergy, characterized by light, non-ornamented eighth notes. Till is still present in this section,
									possibly watching from afar. Unease and tension are built up over the course of the following fifth 
									section through heavy sequencing of Till’s three motifs. A new rhythmic motif of an eighth note, an
									eighth note rest, and an eighth note is introduced to characterize the dark, progressive sixth section,
									which builds to a drastic nasal climax. This is swiftly resolved with an unexpected seventh section
									consisting of a sudden, gleeful, 12-measure phrase and a mysterious, dark sub-section with an oboe
									solo. The eighth section’s function is to build into the ninth section. It accomplishes this by bringing
									back whole chunks from earlier sections and placing them in quick succession, giving them an
									immense sense of forward motion. The epic ninth section brings glory to Till by rehashing old material
									and introducing new material, making it the most exciting part of the entire piece. However, this is
									sadly cut short by a sudden entrance of the clergy motif, indicating that the clergy successfully catch
									Till and begin the march to his execution. In this tenth section, Till’s second motif is heard, first as a
									couple of lighthearted jokes, then as a plead for mercy, which has no effect on the angered clergy. They
									execute him mercilessly. The introduction is brought back and dramatized in the coda, and the piece
									ends with a sudden 8-measure return of the spirit of Till.<br><br>
									Now that I’ve outlined the piece’s progression and motifs, I will discuss the sections of the
									piece that best demonstrate the idea of motivic development.<br><br>
									The fourth section introduces the clergy motif starting in measure 179. Interestingly, the conflict
									between Till and the clergy can be seen in the form of this section, in addition to motivic interaction.
									The first two phrases focus on the clergy entirely, and are both at a comfortable four-bar length. In the
									next eight bars, however, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the two phrases because they are
									linked by the second Till motif. Chromaticism only begins to occur in this section once Till has been
									mentioned, and after a couple of bars, the clergy are able to “recover” from Till’s appearance and
									conclude with a perfect authentic cadence. Till’s second motif makes a romantic gesture in the solo
									violin, then the fourth section concludes in measure 195.<br><br>

									From 196 to 292, the fifth section stretches to cover a wide range of material and accomplish
									multiple things. The violin part from the previous section plays out into a longer violin solo, possibly
									indicating some kind of romantic activity on Till’s part. This solo focuses heavily on the first half of his
									second motif, sequencing it repeatedly up until the high point of the phrase, where the violin glissandos
									down for more than four octaves. Perhaps the most important part of the section occurs at measure 231:
									Till’s first motif becomes a dramatic theme in the high strings. This theme also utilizes the glissando
									from the aforementioned violin solo. After a shift to the parallel major key, the first part of the first
									motif makes an explicit appearance in the solo horn, and the dramatic theme briefly becomes a happy
									one. The second Till motif makes a bouncy appearance as well, resolving down to tonic instead of into
									a leading tone. At the turn of the phrase in measure 253, a change back to the parallel minor and the
									marking wütend (or “angry”) brings the dramatic theme back even heavier than before. This section
									spirals into dense dotted-quarters and a dissonant repetition of the second motif in the high brass until
									the climax at 287, where the horns loudly play the beginning of the first motif.<br><br>
									The eighth section starts at measure 410, building into a grand reappearance of the original horn
									solo from the first section, with an important distinction: when the phrase is repeated, it is now
									sequenced down a minor third. In measure 449, the second horn has the melody in the form of the first
									motif, altered to be a harmonically open, melodically ascending idea. This altered first motif is
									sequenced three times, first up a tritone in the first horn, then up a perfect fourth in the first and third
									horns, and finally up a major seventh in all four horns. Each iteration builds drastically, with the low
									voices standing on the dominant of each key (descending by step in each iteration) for textural support.<br><br>
									The third motif’s introduction from measure 69 reappears in measure 470 with some key
									differences. Firstly, the standing on the dominant lasts four measures instead of two, dragging out the
									buildup to elicit more tension. Secondly, after the full appearance of the third motif in measure 476, the
									repeated eighth-note fragment of the first motif (from the second half of measure 76) is played in
									whole, but is then expanded into a heroic melody carried first by the horns, whom are then joined by
									the trumpets, accompanied all the while by the second motif scattered across the woodwinds. This is
									the grand climax of the piece where Till is most triumphant. The phrase finally ends at measure 500,
									and Till’s heroism begins to die down as the texture thins out and dynamics grow softer. The end of the
									section spirals out of control, losing functional tonality until the arrival of the clergy.
									In measure 559, the clergy start the ninth section with their unexpected entry. This phrase
									contrasts the original appearance of the clergy from measure 179. The first six bars remain melodically
									intact between the two sections, but with some important distinctions. The instrumentation is fuller in
									this new section, and nearly every instrument is contributing to the texture. Some of the lower voices
									and percussion even stand on the dominant. Additionally, the tempo is much faster, carrying over from
									the previous section. These elements in combination paint the clergy as a desperate, driving force,
									rather than a calm and reserved one. A loud, highly dissonant chord across the entire orchestra marks
									Till’s capture at the end of the clergy’s theme.<br><br>
									The remainder of the ninth section consists of a dark funeral march in F-minor. Most of this
									sub-section is spent on the lower voices building the F-minor chord. Till’s first two gestures, found in
									measures 574 and 582, are replicas of the second motif’s first appearance in the clarinet. The third
									gesture in measure 589 is more interesting, as the clarinet part is marked entstellt, or “disfigured”, and
									the motif is interrupted before the last note by the funeral march in the low voices. This creates an
									emotive exchange between Till and his fed-up escorts. The last note of the motif is still played, but it is
									now buried in the dark texture of the funeral march. The march makes its last impression in measure
									605. Till’s last cry comes in the form of the second motif in the clarinet, where instead of ending on a
									sustained note, it continues to ascend by arpeggiating an augmented chord. When the motif arrives at
									the high point of the phrase, it loses any melodic resemblance to Till and falls in all of the woodwinds

									(reminiscent of the romantic gesture Till makes in measure 207). The horns sustain a pedal tone while
									pizzicato strings illustrate the snapping of Till’s neck.<br><br>
									The first five measures of the piece make a return in measure 624 to wrap up the story of Till
									Eulenspiegel, this time developed into a full 18-bar phrase group. The last six measures of this
									Epilogue are devoted to a gentle memorial of Till in the clarinets by borrowing the first two bars of the
									first motif and repeating them, ending on a flat three chord in F-major. Suddenly, a loud appearance of
									a five to one harmonic movement, with an explosive return of Till’s second motif in measure 644,
									evokes the memory of Till’s true nature. The piece ends with chromatic movement in all voices leading
									to a final tonic chord.<br><br>
									Strauss hammers an understanding of Till into the audience, utilizing sheer repetition so that
									even those without a musical background can recognize the appearance of the main character. The
									audience is carried through all kinds of emotions by three simple motifs that Strauss manipulates. At
									times, Till is shown as a jovial prankster, at times a romantic, and at times just a mortal scared for his
									life. Strauss conveys the story effectively in “Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry Pranks”, a work which speaks
									to his great skill as a composer.
