									<h2>Don't Mind Me!</h2>
									<h3>Ludum Dare 46</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The final version is playable in-browser <a href="https://paul-merkamp.itch.io/dont-mind-me">here</a>.
									The source Unity project is also downloadable there to anyone who'd like to see an additional sample of my code or use the assets I created.<br>
									
									<h3>Overview</h3>
									Ludum Dare 46 was the first game jam I've ever participated in. The theme was "Keep it alive", and the jam ran from 
									April 17th to April 20th, 2020. The game ranked 354th of 4,959 "compo" entries, putting it just outside top 7%. Not bad for my first game!<br><br>
									
									From the start, based on the theme, I knew I wanted to create a game where the player was forced to carry something around, protecting it at all costs - 
									this idea coalesced into the disembodied brain that eventually represented the game. Originally, the player was going to place turrets 
									which would defend waves of enemies. However, as the reality of the 48 hour time constraint set in, I realized that 
									developing a fun and functional turret system would be an inefficient use of my time. <br><br>
									
									So, I honed the scope of the project. Instead, the player was given a handheld gun (very similar in appearance to the Polar Star
									in "Cave Story") and would use it to traverse themed areas, defeating increasingly difficult enemies, until the end was reached.
									I never came up with a story for this - perhaps the player is carrying their own brain to safety, or perhaps they are escorting
									a friend. Leaving the narrative in the hands of the player felt like the natural choice since I was mostly focused on game functionality.<br><br>
									
									The result was a colorful world, fun to explore, with a clear objective. The project did have some serious flaws, but overall, I was very 
									satisfied with the end result. The development process deepened my appreciation and love for video games, the development process, 
									and coding in general. <br><br>
									
									The project had some highs and lows that I want to briefly explore here. <br><br>
									
									<h3>Strengths</h3>
									Reviewers found the presentation of the game's mechanics very fun and intuitive - the first room, pictured above, informs the player 
									of which keys they need to press to shoot their gun and proceed (spacebar) as well as 
									to pick up the brain in the jar (E). I also received lots of positive feedback 
									regarding the game's art style. I was pleased by this, as the simple pixel art took very little time to create, but I did take time 
									to select color palettes for each area that would be enjoyable to discover for the player. I even took a couple of opportunities to hide little 
									"sneak peeks" of the next area, showing off these palettes before they were fully employed. In the same vein, a few players also mentioned their 
									appreciation of the player's bouncy walking animation. I hadn't done any scripted animation work prior to this, so getting something natural 
									to work was quite the achievement for me.<br><br>
									
									One of my favorite parts of the whole jam - in my entry's description, I challenged players to find a cute little character 
									named Shmoop, who was tucked away in a secret room. Those who found Shmoop were overjoyed!
									To my delight, one player even took it upon himself to escort Shmoop to the end of the game. I really love player-managed difficulty in games, 
									and this idea of self-imposed challenge is one I'm very interested in exploring in future projects.<br><br>
									
									<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
									Unfortunately, in the final few hours of the jam, I still needed to cap the game off with a finishing sequence, and had no time 
									for even a simple soundtrack. This, along with the grating sound effects that were included in the judged version of the game,
									meant that sound design was the weakest element of the project, which was reflected in the reviews it received. The game also 
									suffered from high artificial difficulty - death means starting from the very beginning of the game, which meant a game over during 
									the final boss was extremely demotivating for players. This issue was worsened by the player's slow walk speed. At times, this served 
									the exact purpose I intended it for - to build tension and anticipation for the next area - but more frequently, it was an annoyance. 
									There was also no gauge indicating remaining health for the player, meaning the only way to figure out how much punishment the little blue 
									fella could take was through painful trial and error.<br><br>
									
									The initial release also had some strange glitches - players could be pushed completely into walls by enemies, forcing them to 
									restart when they hadn't done anything wrong. I was able to resolve this issue in a follow-up release, but the game still has a number 
									of strange (mostly graphical) interactions, like sprites layering incorrectly, that I determined I'd be unable to fix without a 
									major time investment.<br><br>
									
									These issues were all on my radar while I was developing, but the time constraint meant I just didn't have time to resolve them! 
									In most cases, I was consciously sacrificing stability for content. Who knew 48 hours isn't enough to make the perfect game?<br><br>
									
									<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
									I'd made a number of tenative forays into game development, but my commitment to the Ludum Dare competition, and the limitations I was 
									faced with, gave me the opportunity to produce something truly playable and enjoyable for the very first time. My coding chops were stretched to 
									their absolute limit, and I was forced to learn a lot of new skills (new coding techniques, Unity quirks, split-second decision making...) 
									in a very short amount of time. I'm convinced that my merit as a professional in the field jumped because of LD46, 
									and I'm looking forward to participating again!

									<h2>Samuel</h2>
									<h3>JCA Student Collaborative Project</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									In Spring 2020, I composed a 12-minute piece called "Samuel" for brass quartet and piano,
									to be premiered at Butler University's JCA Collaborative. This piece would have been played live, accompanied by dance choreographed by 
									Jacob Shoup, one of Butler's fine dance majors and a good friend of mine. Unfortunately, due to the transition to an online semester,
									2020's JCA Collaborative was cancelled, and the piece was never performed.<br><br>
									
									You can listen to a MIDI of the piece and view its score on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5p3tVvGdYWH9piLIf6l63g">here</a>. (link broken)
									
									<h3>Overview</h3>
									The piece is divided into three sections: an expository first section, a slow and reverant middle section which gradually picks up energy and speed,
									and an exciting final section which unites themes from the first two sections, drawing to a powerful close.
